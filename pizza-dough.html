            Combine the water, yeast and sugar in a small bowl. Set aside for 5 minutes or until
            foamy. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add

             the mixture is combined. Use your hands to bring the dough together in the bowl.

            Brush a bowl lightly with oil. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead
             for 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in the prepared bowl and turn to
             coat in oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draught-free place to
             rise for 30 minutes or until dough doubles in size.
